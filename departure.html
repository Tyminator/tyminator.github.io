	<p>
	i've made the decision to retire and abandon the tyminator
	channel, along with every other tyminator account on the
	internet.
	</p>
	<p>
	i want to start this statement by thanking everyone that has
	seen any of the ridiculous stuff i've put on the internet
	these past 8 years. these times would not have been the same
	without you.
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	well, this is the end of tyminator i guess. thanks for
	reading.
