	<h1>departure</h1>
	<div class="container" style="width: 502px; margin: 0 auto">
	<p>
	i've decided to retire the tyminator channel, along with
	every other tyminator account on the internet.
	</p>
	<p>
	i want to start this statement by thanking everyone that has
	seen and enjoyed any of the ridiculous stuff i've put on the
	internet these past 8 years. these times would not have been
	the same without you.
	</p>
	<p>
	the reason i'm doing this is related to personal information
	tied to these accounts. i was just 10 when i made the main
	channel, and at the time i didn't mind that my personal
	information was all over the account. however, as my use for
	this account changed, i decided that i didn't want my
	personal info tied to the account anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
	the problem with this is that some of this personal info is
	already permanently associated with the account. obviously, 
	i'm not going to tell you where you can find this info, but
	it's out there, and i was kinda stupid for not realizing
	this sooner. i could delete my channel and tell people to
	subscribe to that one, but i don't want to delete any of my
	past videos.
	</p>
	<p>
	these reasons, along with my personal wishes, is why i've
	decided to abandon the tyminator name altogether and
	start fresh elseware. stats don't really matter to me
	anymore; making content is just a hobby for me nowadays.
	i'm still gonna be shitposting on the internet, it'll just
	be under a completely different name.
	</p>
	<p>
	well, this is the end of tyminator i guess. thanks for
	reading.
